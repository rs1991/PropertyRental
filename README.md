The HomeRental application is designed to make things easier for you when it comes to looking for your next rental home. When you move to a new city it can be absolutely daunting looking for somewhere to stay. This is whether you are arranging appointments to view places or filling in all the documents Estate Agents ask for. The other issue faced by many is the need to look through hundreds of rental homes online without finding the right home. The idea of the HomeRental application is to register once and be matched with a list of potential suitable homes based on your requirements which you can always modify later.
